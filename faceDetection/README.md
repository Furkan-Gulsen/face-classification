<h2>Face Detection Methods</h2>

Today, there are many different face detection methods. While some of these are very good detections, some can make bad detections. Causes of bad detections:
- The person wears glasses,
- The person is in a dim environment,
- The person's entire face is not visible
and because of similar reasons, the detection rate of these methods also changes.

I compared the four most used face detection methods in the world. These:
- DNN
- DLIB
- Haarcascade
- MTCNN
